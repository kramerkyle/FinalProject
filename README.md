# Final Project
## Presentation Paragraph
### Selected Topic
Our topic is:
How are health outcomes affected by city's walkability and the availability of public transit?
### Reason We Picked the Topic
We picked this topic because we have all been in a situation where we have not had a car and realized how difficult it is to get everyday necessities. We wanted to know if people are healthier who live in a more walkable area. A good example of this is if the grocery store is two miles and fast food is only a mile would that make a difference, same with health care.
### Questions We Hope to Answer with the Data
  1. Housing density and its effect on overall health
      - Public transit
      - Walkability 
  2. Distance from doctor's / emergency rooms
      - Distance form affordable health care (maybe approved by ACA)
  3. What other factors might affect the outcomes
      - median income
      - car ownership
      - average age
      - food availability
      - size of city
      - ethnicity
  4. Which variables affected the model the most
