Goal: Determine what each group member will contribute to the first project segment. 

Tasks: 
We looked over the first segment rubric. 
Four commits per team member (commit often) 
We discussed looking at multiple options for the machine learning component so that we have more than one model to choose from. 
Chris will be uploading a dataset for heart disease
Rowena will be uploading a dataset for life expectancy 
Savannah sent a walkability and land value dataset to the slack chat 
Rowena sent a food access database to the slack chat 

Decisions: 
We determined that weâ€™d rather do visualization via Tableau than an HTML dashboard
